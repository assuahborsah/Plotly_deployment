# Plotly_deployment

## Project Overview


The purpose of this project is to identify and display charts that will visualize bacterial data of volunteers. These volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. The purpose here is to find the ideal bacterial type to produce Improbable beef. If Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.


## Resources

Visual Studio Code, Chrome, Git Bash, GitHub Pages

## Results


The following steps would be followed for this analysis:

Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart.

Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individualâ€™s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart

Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard

Use your knowledge of HTML and Bootstrap to customize the webpage for your dashboard.
body {

    color: #000000;
    background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
  }
 
 .tag {
     font-family: inherit; 
     font-size: 1rem;
    }  

.jumbotron {
    background-image: url("../images/bacteria.jpg");
    background-size: 100% 100%;
    text-align: center;
  }
  
  
## Summary

When a sample is selected, the dashboard should display the data in the panel and all three charts according to their requirements.
